<h2>what is c ?</h2>
<p>C is s programming language.</p>

<h2>introduction to c language</h2>
<p>C is a high level programming language.orignally developed by Dennies M Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. 
C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972. 
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard. 
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs have been written in C. 
The C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons. 
It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.</p>

<h3 id="fac">facts about C</h3>
<ul><li>C is a successor of B language, which was introduced around 1970.</li>
<li>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute. (ANSI).</li>
<li>The UNIX OS was totally written in C by 1973.</li>
<li>Today, C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</li>
<li>Most of the state-of-the-art softwares have been implemented using C.</li>
<li> Today's most popular Linux OS and RBDMS MySQL have been written in C.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wuc">why to use c?</h3>
<p>C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make up the operating system.
 C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language.</p>
